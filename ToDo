Language
========

To make things a bit simpler, we will aim for a shallow embedding into Scala and pimp it wth a few macros to make it less rough around the edges.
The macro can be used to generate a shadow state and process the changes in variable into the mouvement commands we discussed.

Documentation
=============
write a tutorial


Verification
============

current part
------------

-make the model checker:
  -cached values: emit a warning if we are not sure whether it is supported
  -internalize objects references and make sure they are shared/sync across worlds
  -test memoization
  -better dReal integration
-trace and error:
  -free memory before processing the trace file
  -process the trace file in a streaming fashion

model complex model (extracted from robot description)
-------------------

once we know what kind of operations we need for the model of the physical robot, refactor using spire and make it modular

more robust dReal, sundials integration

If we go toward Taylor Models,
-existing tool:
    flow*: http://systems.cs.colorado.edu/research/cyberphysical/taylormodels/
-for symbolic manipulation (extracting equations from a bond graph), maybe we can interface with maxima:
    http://maxima.sourceforge.net/docs/manual/en/maxima_14.html#SEC74 (polynomial)
    http://maxima.sourceforge.net/docs/manual/en/maxima_21.html#SEC104 (diff eq)
    http://maxima.sourceforge.net/docs/manual/en/maxima_28.html#taylor
-for CAS library:

    C++: http://issc.uj.ac.za/symbolic/symbolic.html, http://www.ginac.de/
