how to generate the appropriate commands for the turtle bot example ?

At the beginning of the sampling period, the robot has speed v₁ and is at position 0.
At the end, the robot should have speed v₂ and should be at position v₂.
the sampling period is t.

given a speed as (x, y) with get
    v = ∥(x,y)∥ = √(x² + y²)
    θ = atan(y/x)

the total rotation is dθ = θ₂ - θ₁.

the maneuver will be done as 3 move command:
    move(v₁, ω₁, t₁)
    move(v₂, ω₂, t₂)
    move(v₃, ω₃, t₃)
we also have a parameter f ∈ (0,1) to control how tight is the maneuver.

t₁ = 3/4∙f∙t
t₂ = 1/4∙f∙t
t₃ = (1-f)∙t

v₁ = ∥v∥∙2∙dθ / (sin(dΘ) + 2∙sin(dΘ/2))
v₂ = v₁
v₃ = ∥v∥

ω₁ = 2∙dθ/(f∙t)
ω₂ = ω₁
ω₃ = 0
