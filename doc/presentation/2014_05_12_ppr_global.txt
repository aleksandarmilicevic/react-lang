-define the goal
    a simple language that makes it easier to program robots *and* reason about them (e.g. no collision)
-status
    previously shown: simple language structured around model-based / event-driven programming
    now: trying to add verification
-two parts:
    planning and functionality -> coordination language
    controller, sensor, and actuator -> hybrid language
    in the middle: API/IR
-coordination:
    the REACT you know
    high-level / global view of the system
    discrete time step and actions
    program the robot with high-level primitives, e.g., move to here (rather that set voltage on the motor)
    somewhere between a verification and planning/synthesis problem (AI/PL)
    ...
-but is that one language ?
    more a collection of DSL
    a framework to program, verify (, and design ?) robots
