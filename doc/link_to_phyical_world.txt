physical description:
    some form of bond graph from which we can extract some informations
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond-graph    
        bonds connects parts and conserve energy: power = effort ∙ flow
        nodes are parts of the robots:
            R: resistance, one port (dissipate power)
            C: capacitance
            I: Inertia
            Se: source of effort
            Sf: source of flow
            TF: transformer, f₁∙r = f₂ ∧ e₁/r = e₂
            GY: gyrator, e₂ = μ∙f₁ ∧ e₁ = μ∙f₂
        links or junctions:
            0 junction: the flow sums to zero and the efforts are equal, ∀a,b. e_a = e_b ∧ ∑f = 0
            1 junction: the efforts sum to zero and the flows are equal, ∀a,b. f_a = f_b ∧ ∑e = 0
