Application domain
------------------
-simple and cheap robots
-educational purpose
-easy to learn

Target audience
---------------
People without much technical background. The language should hide the messy stuff and make it easy to program the robots (and reason about the programs).

Use case
--------
3 quadcopters flying around without colliding (and we can prove it)

Steps (intermediate goals)
--------------------------
-figure out what is possible about hybrid systems verification
-build in the language a clean interface between hybrid verif tools (adapt the programming model accordingly)
-a way of specifying the physical properties of the robot in the language:
    -geometry
    -actuators
    -sensors
    - ? kinematics / dynamics
-use reasoning techniques to hide the complexity of robot's interaction with the environment
